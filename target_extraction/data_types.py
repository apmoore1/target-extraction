    Span is a named tuple. It has two fields:

    1. start -- An integer that specifies the start of a target word within a 
       text.
    2. end -- An integer that specifies the end of a target word within a text.

class Target_Text(MutableMapping):
    '''
    This is a data structure that inherits from MutableMapping which is 
    essentially a python dictionary.

    The following are the default keys that are in all `Target_Text` 
    objects, additional items can be added through __setitem__ but the default 
    items cannot be deleted.

    1. text - The text associated to all of the other items
    2. text_id -- The unique ID associated to this object 
    3. targets -- List of all target words that occur in the text. Can be None.
    4. spans -- List of Span NamedTuples where each one specifies the start and 
       end of the respective targets within the text.
    5. sentiments -- List of integers sepcifying the sentiment of the 
       respective targets within the text.
    6. categories -- List of categories that represent the targets. NOTE: 
       depending on the dataset and how it is parsed the category can exist 
       but the target does not as the category is a latent variable, in these 
       cases the target will be `NULL` and if there are sentiment values the 
       sentiment will be with respect to both the target and the category 
       value.

        text e.g. if the target is `barry davies` in `today barry davies 
        went` then the spans should be [[6,18]] and if the spans, target or 
        text is any different it will raise a ValueError.
